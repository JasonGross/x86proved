(*======================================================================================
  We define a type of "casts".
  - Mathematically, this consists of a partial function [downcast] and a left inverse
    [upcast], together with the defining property [castinv].
  - For our purposes, [upcast] corresponds to *decoding*, and is not necessarily 
    injective (values may have more than one code), and [downcast] corresponds to 
    *encoding*, which may fail, and is not unique (it just *picks* some code).
  ======================================================================================*)
Structure CAST t u := MakeCast
{ upcast: t -> u;
  downcast: u -> option t; 
  castinv : forall x y, downcast x = Some y -> upcast y = x
}.
